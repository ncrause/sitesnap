			<h1>API Usage</h1>
			
			<p>
				SiteSnap provides a free API for invoking website photographs.
				When invoked successfully, it returns a lossless PNG 
				file. Any error condition is represented by an HTTP status
				code.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Limits</h2>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Please be aware</strong> that these usage limits may be
				amended from time to time depending on potential misuse/abuse.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Each limit below is applied per API key, as well as per IP.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><span wicket:id="perMinute">[PER MINUTE]</span> per minute</li>
				<li><span wicket:id="perHour">[PER HOUR]</span> per hour</li>
				<li><span wicket:id="perDay">[PER DAY]</span> per 24-hours</li>
				<li><span wicket:id="perMonth">[PER MONTH]</span> per 30-days</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Making a Call</h2>
			
			<h3>Authentication</h3>
			
			<p>
				Each request must be accompanied by an HTTP authorization
				header: <code>Authorization: Basic bmF0aGFuQGNyYXVzZS5uYW1lOmFwaS1rZXk=</code>
				where the username is your e-mail address, and the password
				is your assigned API key.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Errors</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>401 - May be caused by one of the following:
					<ol>
						<li>HTTP Authentication header wasn't supplied correctly</li>
						<li>Unable to locate the supplied email address (user)</li>
						<li>If the password was incorrect</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>417 - May be caused by one of the following:
					<ol>
						<li>if the authentication tokens couldn't be extracted (for example if you are using a method other than "basic" authentication)</li>
						<li>if you are missing one of the required parameters</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>403 - if you have exceeded the usage limits</li>
				<li>400 - if one of the parameter supplied is malformed</li>
			</ul>
