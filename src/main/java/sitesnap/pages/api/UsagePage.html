			<h1>API Usage</h1>
			
			<p>
				SiteSnap provides a free API for invoking website photographs.
				When invoked, it returns either a lossless PNG file, or a
				response structure in JSON. You can tell which has been
				returned by either inspecting the <code>Content-Type</code>
				header, or by the HTTP status code - <code>200</code> will
				<strong>always</strong> only be returned if a successful
				photograph was taken.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Limits</h2>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Please be aware</strong> that these usage limits may be
				amended from time to time depending on potential misuse/abuse.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Each limit below is applied per API key, as well as per IP.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><span wicket:id="perMinute">[PER MINUTE]</span> per minute</li>
				<li><span wicket:id="perHour">[PER HOUR]</span> per hour</li>
				<li><span wicket:id="perDay">[PER DAY]</span> per 24-hours</li>
				<li><span wicket:id="perMonth">[PER MONTH]</span> per 30-days</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Making a Call</h2>
			
			<h3>Authentication</h3>
			
			<p>
				Each request must be accompanied by an HTTP authorization
				header: <code>Authorization: Basic bmF0aGFuQGNyYXVzZS5uYW1lOmFwaS1rZXk=</code>
				where the username is your e-mail address, and the password
				is your assigned API key.
